# Changelog

## [1.3.3] – 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- `tile_map_chunk.hooks.gd` failed to parse on game load (`var d := abs(x - 14)` infers a
  type from a Variant, which Godot treats as an error), so none of its hooks
  (`generate_chunk`, `lvl_from_global_pos_*`, `generate_chests`) were ever installed.
- With the file loading again, terrain generation now matches vanilla exactly (tiles, sprite
  variants, RNG stream and chest placement, verified on all seven maps with fixed seeds):
  - `lvl_from_global_pos_STANDARD/FUNNEL/SKY_MINE/SHALLOW` are no longer hooked. Sharing one
    jitter draw per tile changed where layer boundaries fall and shifted the RNG stream for
    everything generated after it. `TIGHTFUNNEL` (no jitter) stays optimised.
  - SPARSE / SPARSE SKY MINE: `generate_chunk` rolls the skip chance for every passing tile, as
    vanilla does, instead of stopping at the first accepted one.
- `generate_chunk` remains about 6x faster than vanilla (median ~3-5 ms vs ~19-24 ms per chunk).

## [1.3.2] – 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- `tile_map_manager.hooks.gd` referenced `DerFlohPerfMod._debug` by class name,
  silently preventing all hooks in that file (`load_chunks`, `apply_tile_effects`)
  from registering. Replaced with `load(MOD_MAIN_PATH)._debug`.

## [1.3.1] – 2026-06-09

### Removed

- Settings tab (Debug Logging was its only control); toggle `debug_logging` via the config JSON file instead

## [1.3.0] – 2026-04-27

### Added

- Settings tab with Debug Logging toggle (default: off); gates load_chunks zone-rebuild stats in `tile_map_manager.hooks.gd`

## [1.2.0] – 2026-04-19

### Added

- Optimised `lvl_from_global_pos_TIGHTFUNNEL`: computes `abs(x - 14)` once per tile instead of up to 19 times

### Changed

- Updated compatible game version to 1.4.1.1

## [1.1.0] – 2026-04-04

### Added

- `electric_shock._physics_process` hook: replaces the O(n²) array membership scan with an O(1) Dictionary hit-set, inlines the 4-neighbour checks to eliminate per-frontier-tile array allocations, and caps visual arc nodes to `max_electric_visuals` from game_limits_mod config (fallback: 200)

## [1.0.0] – 2026-04-04

- Initial release
- Optimised `load_chunks`: skips zone rebuild when no chunkloader crosses a chunk boundary; uses O(1) shadow dict for queue deduplication
- Optimised `apply_tile_effects`: iterates `chunks_created` dict directly (no `get_children()` allocation per tick); skips idle outer-ring chunks
- Optimised `generate_chunk`: pre-filtered per-level tile bucket sorted rarest-first; inlined `set_cell()` call; falls back to vanilla for `only_coal` path
- Optimised `lvl_from_global_pos_STANDARD/FUNNEL/SKY_MINE/SHALLOW`: computes boundary jitter angle once per tile instead of once per depth threshold
- Optimised `generate_chests`: replaces blocking `load()` per chest with a module-level `preload()`
